Bitcoin Price Predictions-My research question were- i. Can I create a model that predicts Bitcoin’s future price? ii. If so, based on the model, would I recommend that a company invest in Bitcoin?

Bitcoin was deemed as a hedge to inflation, because of a max supply. Too, it is seen
as a way for people to purchase goods and services that they otherwise couldn’t due to a
worthless currency in their country. As Bitcoin became more popular, it has turned into an investment
opportunity. Therefore, I want to convince stakeholders to buy-in by showing them that Bitcoin
will continue to rise in value, thus giving them a great return on investment for the business.
They should care about this because Bitcoin has a max supply thus it's great to hedge against
inflation if they chose to hold onto it as a currency rather than sell it. Too, it isn’t mainstream with
the public and has the ability to get more investors, thus growing value, and giving out great
return on investment. The dataset has the high, low, open, and close price of Bitcoin from 2013 to 2021. It also has volume and market cap on those days. My model of choice was the ARIMA. This stands for Autoregressive integrated moving average. This model is fitted to
time series data either to better understand the data or to predict future points in the series
(forecasting). I chose this model because using the ARIMA model, you can forecast a time
series using the series past values.
